The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with mysterious millionaire
Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his
former lover, Daisy Buchanan.


During World War II, the novel experienced an abrupt surge in popularity when the Council on Books in Wartime distributed free copies to American soldiers serving overseas. This new-found popularity launched a critical and scholarly re-examination, and the work soon became a core part of most A
merican high school curricula and a part of American popular culture. Numerous stage and film adaptations followed in the subsequent decades.
